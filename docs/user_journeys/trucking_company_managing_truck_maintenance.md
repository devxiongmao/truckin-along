# User Journey: Trucking Company Managing Truck Maintenance

## Persona

**Name:** Peter Parker  
**Role:** Driver or admin affiliated with a trucking company using the Truckin' Along platform  
**Goal:** Record and manage maintenance information for a truck in the companyâ€™s fleet

---

## Journey Overview

As trucks rack up mileage and time on the road, regular maintenance becomes critical for performance, safety, and regulatory compliance. Usersâ€”typically admins, but ideally also driversâ€”are responsible for logging this maintenance in the system. This journey describes how a user is notified of upcoming or due maintenance, fills out the necessary form, and links that data to the truckâ€™s record.

## Steps

1. **Entry Point**

   - The user receives an **email notification** alerting them that a truck in their fleet is due for maintenance.
   - They navigate to the **Admin dashboard** via the top navigation bar or the main dashboard page
   - Route: `/admin` (e.g., http://localhost:3000/admin) or `/dashboard` (e.g., http://localhost:3000/dashboard)

2. **Initiate Maintenance**

   - On the Admin dashboard, each truck entry that has due maintenance includes a visible **orange `Maintenance` button**.
   - Clicking this button opens a **modal labeled `Maintenance Form`**.
   - Alternatively, on the Dashboard page, Drivers will see this same view and can complete the maintenance for the trucks.

3. **Fill Out the Maintenance Form**

   - Within the modal, the user is prompted to complete the following fields:
     - **Maintenance Title**
     - **Date of Completion**
     - **Current Mileage**
     - **Checkboxes** confirming:
       - Oil Change
       - Tire Pressure Check
     - **Optional Notes** field for additional comments

4. **Submit the Maintenance Form**

   - After completing the form, the user clicks **`Confirm and Submit`**.
   - On success:
     - Maintenance data is saved and linked to the truckâ€™s record.
     - The modal closes and the user returns to the Admin dashboard.
   - On failure:
     - An error message is displayed, and the form data is retained for correction.
