# User Journey: Trucking Company Claiming a Shipment

## Persona

**Name:** Peter Parker  
**Role:** Driver or admin associated with a trucking company using the Truckin' Along platform  
**Goal:** Submit bids to claim customer shipments for deliveryâ€”either partially or in fullâ€”to generate revenue for the company

## Journey Overview

When a customer posts a shipment to the Truckin' Along platform, trucking companies have the opportunity to claim and deliver it. This journey follows a userâ€”driver or adminâ€”who is browsing the available deliveries, reviewing shipment details, submitting bids, and awaiting customer approval. Claiming a shipment kicks off the delivery lifecycle and allows companies to earn income through successful drop-offs.
