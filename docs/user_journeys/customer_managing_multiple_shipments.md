## Steps

1. **Entry Point**

   - After logging in, the user navigates to the Shipments menu.
   - Route: `/shipments` (http://localhost:3000/shipments)

2. **Click the New Shipment Button**

   - User clicks the "New Shipment" button to begin the creation process.
   - Route changes to: `/shipments/new`

3. **Fill Out the New Shipment Form**

   - User fills out the form, which requires:
     - Shipment name
     - Recipient name
     - Recipient address
     - Weight
     - Length, height, and width
   - The senderâ€™s name and address are pre-populated but editable.
   - If the user doesn't have all necessary information, they will need to return to this step later.

4. **Create the New Shipment**

   - Once the form is complete, the user clicks the "Save Shipment" button.
   - User is redirected to the shipment show page: `/shipments/:id`
   - A banner at the top confirms successful creation.
   - If there are validation errors, the form reloads with all data preserved and an error alert is shown.

5. **Verification**

   - On the show page, a map displays the shipmentâ€™s straight-line travel distance.
   - This provides a visual cue to confirm the entered data is accurate.
   - The user may click the `Edit Shipment` button if changes are needed.

6. **Optional: Duplicate the Shipment â†’ Click the Copy Button**

   - The user may click the `Copy Shipment` button if they need to copy a majority of the fields for a subsequent shipment.
   - This leads to the shipment copy page: `/shipments/:id/copy`
   - The user returns to Step 3 and can repeat Steps 3â€“5 as many times as needed.

7. **Outcome**

   - Back on the `/shipments` page, the user can now view all of their created shipments.
