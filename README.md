## üîß Environment Setup

### Azure Maps API Key

Truckin' Along uses Azure Maps for geocoding services. You'll need to set up an API key:

1. **Get an Azure Maps API Key**:

   - Visit the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Maps/Common/MenuBlade/Keys)
   - Create a new Azure Maps account or use an existing one
   - Copy your primary or secondary key

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and add your Azure Maps API key:
     ```bash
     AZURE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Security Notes**:
   - Never commit your `.env` file to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
   - For production, set environment variables through your hosting platform
   - The `.env.example` file serves as documentation for required variables

### Other Environment Variables

Additional environment variables can be added to your `.env` file as needed:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: info)
