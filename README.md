# üöõ Truckin' Along

Truckin' Along is a revolutionary crowdsourced shipping platform that democratizes package delivery and logistics. Built on Rails, it connects anyone who needs to ship something with anyone who has space in their vehicle - creating a community-driven marketplace that makes shipping affordable, flexible, and accessible to all.

**üåü The Power of Crowdsourcing**: No commercial trucks required! Whether you're a professional driver, someone with a pickup truck, or just heading in the right direction with extra cargo space, you can earn money by delivering packages. Similarly, anyone can send a shipment - from individuals moving apartments to small businesses needing cost-effective delivery solutions.

## üåç How Truckin' Along Works

### The Crowdsourced Marketplace

Truckin' Along operates on a simple yet powerful principle: **anyone can ship, anyone can deliver**. Our platform connects two groups of people:

**üì¶ Shippers (Anyone with something to send)**

- Individuals moving homes or selling items online
- Small businesses needing affordable delivery
- Students shipping belongings between dorms
- Families sending care packages
- Anyone who needs something transported

**üöó Drivers/Deliverers (Anyone with transportation)**

- Professional truck drivers looking for additional loads
- People with pickup trucks, vans, or SUVs
- Commuters traveling regular routes who want to earn extra income
- Retirees with time and reliable vehicles
- College students with cars looking for side income
- **No special licenses or commercial vehicles required!**

### Getting Started is Simple

**For Shippers**: Create an account, post your shipment details (pickup location, destination, size, timeline), and wait for drivers to bid on your delivery.

**For Drivers**: Sign up, verify your identity and vehicle, browse available shipments on routes you're already taking (or willing to take), place bids, and start earning money by helping your community.

## üìã Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Ruby**: `3.x` or newer
- **Rails**: `8.x` or newer
- **pnpm**: `10.x` or newer
- **PostgreSQL** (or another supported database)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized development)

---

## üîß Environment Setup

### Azure Maps API Key

Truckin' Along uses Azure Maps for geocoding services. It's recommended to use this service for optimal performance. If you skip this setup, Truckin' Along will still work, you will just be using the `Nominatim` api instead. You can get your free Azure API key by performing the following steps.

1. **Get an Azure Maps API Key**:

   - Visit the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-maps)
   - Create a new Azure Maps account or use an existing one
   - Copy your primary or secondary key

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and add your Azure Maps API key or your Nominatim user agent:
     ```bash
     AZURE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
     NOMINATIM_USER_AGENT=your_user_agent
     ```

3. **Security Notes**:
   - Never commit your `.env` file to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
   - For production, set environment variables through your hosting platform
   - The `.env.example` file serves as documentation for required variables

### Other Environment Variables

Additional environment variables can be added to your `.env` file as needed:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: info)
